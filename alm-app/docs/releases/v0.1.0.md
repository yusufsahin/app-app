Release date: 2026-02-25  
Tag: `v0.1.0`  
Commit: `fb9551f`

## Summary
- Major feature expansion across backend and frontend in a single milestone (`320 files changed`, `+25,638 / -589`).
- Backend adds new domains and capabilities: area, task, team, comment, attachment, artifact links, saved queries, workflow rules, admin/audit, realtime, and metadata-driven schemas.
- Frontend adds board/planning/automation/access-audit surfaces, manifest editor/designer improvements, expanded API clients, and additional tests/utilities.
- Platform/dev tooling adds CI, Dependabot, pre-commit, Playwright/Vitest scaffolding, and bundle-size checks.
- Documentation updated broadly for policy/ACL integration, board context, gap analysis, and manifest references.

## Backend highlights
- New modules: `admin`, `area`, `artifact_link`, `attachment`, `comment`, `cycle`, `form_schema`, `realtime`, `saved_query`, `task`, `team`, `workflow_rule`.
- Expanded project and artifact application flows (member management, updates, queries, event handlers).
- Shared architecture and infrastructure additions (event dispatcher, unit of work, specifications, rate limiting, field masking, ACL ports).

## Database migrations
- Added migration chain `009` through `027`, including:
  - process template fields and project settings
  - project members and artifact sequencing/state metadata
  - tasks, comments, cycles, areas
  - artifact links and attachments
  - saved queries and workflow rules
  - teams and access audit

## Frontend highlights
- New feature pages: Board, Planning, Automation, Access Audit.
- Metadata-driven UI primitives: form/list generation and manifest editor enhancements.
- New API layers for admin/task/comment/attachment/artifact link/saved query/workflow rule/form-list schema.
- Added/updated tests and utility coverage for APIs, permissions, routing paths, and manifest schema/workflow helpers.

## DevEx and CI
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and Dependabot config.
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Added frontend E2E and test tooling configuration (`playwright`, `vitest`, bundle-size script).

## Notes
- This release currently includes generated E2E artifacts:
  - `frontend/e2e/.auth/user.json`
  - `frontend/e2e/test-results/.last-run.json`
  - `frontend/playwright-report/index.html`
- Consider excluding these from future production tags via `.gitignore` and publishing a small cleanup patch release.
